enka-py relies on several game assets to fill-in things like weapon names, stats icons, etc. that are not provided by the API.  
To speed up the process, these game assets are downloaded when you first use the client and are stored locally on your machine.  
enka-py doesn't know when the local assets are outdated, therefore you'd need to update them when necessary. How to handle this process is up to you, I personally just run it once every single day in the morning.
